# LoginManager
Library to manage logins and registrations.

A small component/library created for an assignment.

The component is designed to allow a system that needs to allow access to various users based on entered credentials and to encrypt and store the credentials securely. Currently, the component allows you to register, log in and change your password. Data can be stored locally or via SQL. In the future, additional functions will be added (for example, the ability to change the password after providing a generated code, the ability to assign parameters to users) and other ways to save data. If the current options aren't acceptable, but you still want to use this specifically, you can assign your own function to a method, download and edit according to the GNU-GPL license or leave a message and/or issue report.
